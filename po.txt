The rain is made from mostly water and I will add a side note and rain
water is a combination of molecules
hydrogen and oxygen molecules make water
hydrogen in two portions and oxygen in one portion
that is why it is called H2O
and this H2O is still within rain
rain is a part of the cycles
water is a natural resource
the water cycle is a nature process that takes the water of the earth around
I have made some additions and edits
well done on the additions and edits
whenever it rains water drops pour from the sky
